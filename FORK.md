## 🎯 Why This Fork?

This fork is built by **Oscar Serra**, an inventor and AI enthusiast who believes in giving AI assistants **full access** to be truly helpful. We take a **trust-first approach** — no sandboxing, no artificial restrictions, just a capable AI partner.

### Philosophy

> "An AI assistant with no access is just a search engine with extra steps."

We believe:

- **Trust first, restrict later** (if ever needed)
- **Multi-model resilience** — never be stuck when one provider rate-limits you
- **Linux-native** — optimized for Ubuntu, not an afterthought
- **Community-driven** — we document everything for newcomers

---

## ✨ What's Different Here?

### 🔐 Security Patches Applied

All critical upstream security PRs cherry-picked:

- **#7769** — DNS Rebinding Protection
- **#7616** — Zip Path Traversal Fix
- **#7704** — WebSocket Auth Enforcement

### 🧠 Smart Model Management

- **Smart Router V2** (#7770) — Auto-selects the best model for each task
- **Rate Limiting** (#7644) — Prevents runaway API costs
- **Anthropic Failover** — Auto-switches to Gemini when Claude hits quota (tested & verified!)

### 📦 Enhanced Skills

| Skill              | Description                                       | Status       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `youtube-ultimate` | FREE transcripts (no API cost!) + video downloads | ✅ v2.0      |
| `google-sheets`    | Content calendars, spreadsheet automation         | ✅ Installed |
| `healthcheck`      | System security auditing                          | ✅ Installed |

### 📱 WhatsApp Full History (Coming Soon)

We're enabling Baileys' full history sync — your AI will have access to all your WhatsApp messages, not just new ones. **Opt-in via config.**

### 🐧 Ubuntu-Native

- Tested on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04
- Works with `deja-dup` for backups
- Systemd service examples included
- No macOS-only skills (we removed Bear Notes)

## 🤖 Multi-Model Support

We run **multiple AI subscriptions** for resilience and capability:

| Provider      | Model              | Use Case                            |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus 4.5    | Primary chat, coding, complex tasks |
| **Google**    | Gemini 3 Pro       | Failover, large context, vision     |
| **Manus**     | manus-1.6-adaptive | Background research, deep analysis  |

### Failover Chain

```
Claude (primary) → Gemini (rate limit) → [Your Local Model]
```

When Claude hits its quota, we **automatically switch to Gemini** with zero downtime. This was tested and verified on 2026-02-03 when both providers rate-limited within minutes of each other!

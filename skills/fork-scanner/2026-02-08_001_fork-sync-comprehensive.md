# KEY METRICS & STATUS

## Sync Dashboard

| Metric | Value | Status | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Commits Behind | 519 | 🔴 CRITICAL | < 20 |
| Days Since Merge | 35 | 🔴 CRITICAL | < 7 |
| Our Version | 2026.2.1 | — | — |
| Conflict Risk | NONE | ✅ SAFE | — |

## Impact of Drift

Being 519 commits behind means:
- **Missing Telegram spoiler tags** — Users can't hide spoiler content
- **Vulnerable to context overflow bugs** — Fixed in #11664
- **Stale cron scheduler** — Reliability issues fixed in #10776
- **No native Voyage AI** — Memory embeddings require workaround

# THE WATCHMAN'S NOTES

*By Jarvis — Your Fork Intelligence Agent*

## This Week's Priority

**Sync today.** The 519-commit drift is the only blocker. No conflicts detected. Safe to merge.

## Observations

1. **Chinese market dominates fork ecosystem** — 3 of top 5 forks are China-focused. Not relevant to our use case.

2. **Security forks exist but are small** — titanicprime/moltbot-safe worth auditing, but only 12 stars suggests limited adoption.

3. **Upstream is active** — 15 commits in last 2 weeks shows healthy project velocity.

## Process Improvements Proposed

1. **Weekly sync schedule** — Set reminder for Sunday evening sync to avoid 5-week gaps
2. **Automated drift alerts** — Trigger warning when >50 commits behind
3. **Performance gems focus** — Create filter to find optimization-focused forks

## Looking Ahead

Next issue will include:
- Post-merge verification report
- Skills Radar section (new skills in ecosystem)
- Performance benchmark comparison
